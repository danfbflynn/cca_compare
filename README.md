 -### Somerville comparison tool online at http://flynnd.io/articles/CCA_Compare/

 -Goal: Illustrate how Communicy Choice Aggregation (CCA) plans change amounts of renewable electricity and generation rates
 -
 -The Somerville Community Choice Electricity (CCE) Aggregation plan began July 2017. See the [Somerville CCE page](https://somervillecce.com) for more information. This tool is being updated to include plans of other Massachusetts municipalities as well.

 -For Somerville, tanslating the information on the [CCE mailer](https://somervilledev.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/somerville-opt-out-eversource-2017-final.pdf) to your bill is not straightforward. The new program will acheive stable electricity pricing, increase Somerville's commitment to local renewable energy, and provide residents an option to opt up to 100% local renewable energy as their source of electricity. This calculator attempts to provide an easy way to compare how the options will affect your bill, with a goal of showing that the benefits of 100% local renewable energy can be acheived with a relatively modest increase in a household's bill.
