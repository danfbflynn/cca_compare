# Comparing Renewable Electricity Options for Somerville

### Online at https://flynn.shinyapps.io/somervillecce_compare/

The Somerville Community Choice Electricity (CCE) Aggregation began July 2017 See the [Somerville CCE page](https://somervillecce.com) for more information.

Translating the information on the [CCE mailer](https://somervilledev.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/somerville-opt-out-eversource-2017-final.pdf) to your bill is not straightforward. The new program will acheive stable electricity pricing, increase Somerville's commitment to local renewable energy, and provide residents an option to opt up to 100% local renewable energy as their source of electricity. This calculator attempts to provide an easy way to compare how the options will affect your bill, with a goal of showing that the benefits of 100% local renewable energy can be acheived with a relatively modest increase in a household's bill.

A monthly bill is calculated as follows:

kWh * Generation Rate + kWh * Delivery Rate + Customer Charge
